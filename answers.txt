Question 3: Reading Syllabus
-i. The people you work with must be stated in the document you submit with homework
-ii. You can consult any available resources (printed or online) when doing homework assignments, except
generative AI tools, like ChatGPT. Always read and understand the material you find. Then put it aside and
start writing your own answer. This ensures that the work you submit is different enough that it becomes
your own. Similarly, you can discuss your ideas with your class mates for homework assignments.
However, do not do your homework with individuals outside of your group. You are welcome to use
concepts that were not covered in class, which you might already know or found online, but you must be
able to verbally explain your solution and show thorough understanding of the concepts you used, when
asked.
